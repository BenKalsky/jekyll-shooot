  <h1>Jekyll Shooot</h1>
  <p><strong>Jekyll</strong> is a static site generator that’s perfect for GitHub hosted blogs. (<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll Repository</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Jekyll Now</strong> makes it easier to create Jekyll blogs, by eliminating a lot of the setup. (<a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now" target="_blank">Jekyll Now Repository</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Jekyll Shooot</strong> makes it easier to create Jekyll portfolios, by adding <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble" target="_blank">Jribbble</a> & <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hugeinc/flexboxgrid-sass" target="_blank">Flexboxgrid-sass</a> and more…</p>
  <h3>Build a Jekyll-dribbble portfolio in minutes, without touching the command line!</h3>
  <p>Check it out in <a href="https://github.com/benkalsky/benkalsky.github.io">this repository</a> and of course, the <a href="http://benkalsky.net">portfolio here</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You don’t need to touch the command line</li>
    <li>You don’t need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:</li>
    <li>You don’t need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc</li>
    <li>If you’re on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier</li>
    <li>It’s easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don’t like it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In a few minutes you’ll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!</p>
  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  <h3>STEP 1: Fork Jekyll Shoot to your User Repository</h3>
  <p>Fork this repo, then rename the repository to <a href="#">username.github.io</a>.</p>
  <p>Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <a href="#">http://username.github.io</a> (if it’s not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)</p>
  <h3>STEP 2: Customize and view your site</h3>
  <p>Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the <code>_config.yml</code> file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.</p>
  <p><strong>Don’t forget</strong> to enter a Dribbble <code>Username</code> and <code>Client Access Token</code> to generate the portfolio (<a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble#setting-your-apps-client-access-token">Read more</a>).</p>
  <p>Making a change to <code>_config.yml</code> (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <a href="http://username.github.io">http://username.github.io</a> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it’ll appear soon</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog’s files:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Edit files within your new <a href="#">username.github.io</a> repository in the browser at <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a> (shown below).</li>
      <li>Use a third party GitHub content editor, like <a href="http://prose.io" target="_blank">Prose by Development Seed</a>. It’s optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.</li>
      <li>Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <h3></a>STEP 3: Publish your first blog post</h3>
  <p>Edit <code>/_posts/2017-3-1-Hello-World.html</code> to publish your first blog post. This <a href="http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/" target="_blank">Markdown Cheatsheet</a> might come in handy.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You can add additional posts in the browser on <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a> too! Just hit the + icon in <code>/_posts/</code> to create new content. Just make sure to include the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/" target="_blank">front-matter</a> block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post’s filename is in this format: <code>YYYY-MM-DD-Fancy-Title.md</code> or <code>YYYY-MM-DD-Fancy-Title.html</code></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Local Development</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. <code>gem install github-pages</code> This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.</li>
    <li>Clone down your fork <code>git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git</code></li>
    <li>Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes <code>jekyll serve</code></li>
    <li>View your website at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</a></li>
    <li>Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a id="Contributing_67"></a>Contributing</h2>
  <p>Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you’ve never contributed to an open source project before I’m more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.</p>
  <p>You can start by <a href="https://github.com/benkalsky/jekyll-shooot/issues/new">opening an issue</a> describing the problem that you’re looking to resolve and we’ll go from there.</p>
  <p>I want to keep Jekyll Shooot as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that’s useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it’s not something that most people will use, it probably won’t get merged. :guardsman:</p>
